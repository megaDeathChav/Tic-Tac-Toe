"""
PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS BELOW AND THE HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START CODING

 The file where you will need to create the GUI which should include (i) drawing the grid, (ii) call your Minimax/Negamax functions
 at each step of the game, (iii) allowing the controls on the GUI to be managed (e.g., setting board size, using 
                                                                                 Minimax or Negamax, and other options)
 In the example below, grid creation is supported using pygame which you can use. You are free to use any other 
 library to create better looking GUI with more control. In the __init__ function, GRID_SIZE (Line number 36) is the variable that
 sets the size of the grid. Once you have the Minimax code written in multiAgents.py file, it is recommended to test
 your algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning) on a 3x3 GRID_SIZE to see if the computer always tries for a draw and does 
 not let you win the game. Here is a video tutorial for using pygame to create grids http://youtu.be/mdTeqiWyFnc
